Rock paper scissors lizard what now?
Lizard spock is a free expansion pack for the much-loved game of rock paper scissors. The additional characters were added by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla before being adopted, reordered, and overpopularised by The Big Bang Theory.

Lizard and Spock reduce the chance of a tie by eating, smashing, poisoning or vaporising their opponents, as is their birthright.

The rules
Scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. Rock crushes scissors.
